# 💄 Cosmetic Insights – Navigating Cosmetics Trends and Consumer Insights with Tableau

## 📌 Project Overview

**Cosmetic Insights** is a Tableau-based data visualization project designed to help cosmetic brands, marketers, and analysts gain a deeper understanding of product performance, pricing patterns, and consumer preferences. The dashboard offers real-time insights into brand rankings, skin-type suitability, and product label trends to support strategic decision-making in the beauty industry.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In the fast-paced cosmetics market, brands often lack access to clean, structured insights about their products, customer needs, and market trends. Our project addresses this challenge by providing a centralized, interactive dashboard for analyzing:

- Brand performance
- Price vs. Brand analysis
- Suitability for different skin types (Sensitive, Oily, Normal, Dry)
- Product label effectiveness
- Product ranking comparisons

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The dataset was preprocessed using the following steps:

- Removed null values and duplicates
- Standardized brand and label naming conventions
- Converted ranking and price fields to numeric types
- Verified data types for compatibility with Tableau

---

## 📊 Dashboard Insights

We created two interactive dashboards:

### 🔍 1. Product Ranking and Detailed Analysis
- Top Brands Pie Chart
- Label Count Bar Chart
- Price vs Brand Distribution
- Brand vs Ranking Comparison

### 💡 2. Product Suitability Overview
- Suitability by Skin Type (Oily, Sensitive, Normal, Dry)
- Label vs Average Ranking Analysis

These dashboards allow users to filter and explore insights based on brand, label, and suitability categories.
